<h1>ðŸ“Š Excel Analyzer Platform- ExcelAnalyzer.ai</h1>

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
ExcelAnalyzer.ai Platform is a powerful web application that allows users to upload Excel files (`.xls` / `.xlsx`), analyze the data, and create interactive 2D & 3D charts.
Users can dynamically select **X and Y axes** from column headers, choose chart types, and **download graphs as PNG/PDF**.  
Each user's history of uploads and analyses is saved in a personal dashboard. An **Admin panel** enables monitoring of users and managing data usage. 
The platform additionally provides smart insights, summaries, or reports from the uploaded data.
